# ðŸ‘‹ HelloUser

Inspired by the classic "Hello, World!", the traditional first program when learning a new language, this project is called **HelloUser** because it's my very first program.

It's a friendly system that manages user registrations by saving names and ages to a .txt file.
This project provides a strong foundation for future improvements, such as adding more user details and features, as well as switching to more advanced storage formats.

**(The menu options and files are in a language other than English)**
