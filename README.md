# HelloUser

Inspired by the classic "Hello, World!" â€” the traditional first program when learning a new language -
This project is called **HelloUser** because it's my very first program that interacts with and stores information about users.

Consists in a beginner-friendly system project made with Python, which manages user registrations by saving names and ages to a .txt file.
This project can easily be extended in the future to include more fields or use other storage formats like JSON or databases.
